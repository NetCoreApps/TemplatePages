<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplateWebsites">Template Websites</a> shows the versatility and flexibility 
    possible with Templates where you're able to develop entire content-rich, database-driven websites, not just without any
    C# code, but without ever needing to build your App! If your Web App requirements fits within the constraints of a Template
    Website, there's never been an easier and faster way to develop a Web App in .NET.
</p>

<h4>Dramatically Simplified</h4>

<p>
    Not having to write any C# code or perform any app builds dramatically reduces the cognitive overhead and conceptual knowledge 
    required for development where the only thing front-end Web developers need to know is <a href="/docs/syntax">Template's syntax</a> 
    and what filters are available to call. 
    All complexity with C#, .NET, namespaces, references, .dlls, strong naming, packages, MVC, Razor, build tools, IDE environments, etc 
    has been eliminated leaving all Web Developers needing to do is run a <em>web</em> .NET Core executable and configure a simple 
    <em>web.settings</em> text file to specify where the website files are and what database they want to connect to (if any). 
    For simple websites without db connectivity the <em>webRoot</em> can be inferred and no <em>web.settings</em> is needed.
    Deployments are also simplified as no build environment needs to be configured or builds run, you'll just be able to xcopy the 
    <em>web</em> exe's release folder for the target platform and the Template Website directory to the remote server.
</p>

<p>
    Because of Template's high-fidelity with JavaScript, developing a Website with Templates will be instantly familiar to 
    JavaScript devs despite calling and binding directly to .NET APIs behind the scenes.
</p>

<h4>Ultimate Development Experience</h4>

<p>
    In addition to simplicity, the iterative development experience is unparalleled for a .NET App where for the most part
    you can just leave the <em>web</em> exe running and add the <em>.html</em> template files needed to build your App. 
    No pre-compilation is required so you can just refresh your page to instantly view modified changes. You'll just 
    need to restart the <em>web</em> exe in order to pick up any config changes.
</p>

<h4>Extensible Base</h4>

<p>
    Whilst we've initially developed a Self-contained .NET Core App 
    (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd">SCD</a>)
    to illustrate the concept, the lightweight
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplateWebsites/tree/master/src/TemplateWebsites">Template Websites</a> also serves as 
    a good foundation to enhance with any additional .NET Core or ServiceStack features 
    
    you may need as well as extending its 
    features with custom App filters or Services where you can then run 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplateWebsites/blob/master/src/TemplateWebsites/build-all.bat">build-all.bat</a>    
    to produce a richer and more capable <em>web</em> exe that's more capable of supporting your App's requirements. 
</p>

<p>
    If your development team is comprised of front-end and back-end .NET developers, back-end .NET developers can be responsible 
    for maintaining a customized <em>web</em> .exe containing all the features, APIs and back-end Services that's needed for
    front-end developers to implement your company's App requirements where they're able to develop several different Web Apps
    using the same <em>web</em> exe. Essentially similar to front-end devs using ajax in JavaScript Apps to call back-end APIs,
    they can use Template Websites to develop server-generated Websites and call .NET APIs directly.
