<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplateWebsites">Template Websites</a> shows the versatility and flexibility made
    possible with Templates where you're able to develop entire content-rich, database-driven websites, not just without any
    C# code, but without ever needing to build your App! If your Web App requirements fits within the constraints of a Template
    Website, there has never been an easier and faster way to develop a Web App in .NET.
</p>

<h4>Dramatically Simplified</h4>

<p>
    Not having to write any code or perform any app builds dramatically reduces the cognitive overhead and conceptual knowledge 
    required for development where the only thing front-end Web developers need to know is 
    <a href="/docs/syntax">Template's syntax</a> and what filters are available to call. 
    All complexity with C#, .NET, namespaces, references, .dlls, strong naming, packages, MVC, Razor, build tools, etc have been 
    completely eliminated. All Web Developers need to do is run a <em>web</em> .NET Core executable and configure a simple 
    <em>web.settings</em> text file to specify where the website files are and what database they want to connect to (if any). 
    For simple websites the webroot can be inferred and no <em>web.settings</em> is needed.
</p>

<p>
    Because of Template's high-fidelity with JavaScript, developing a Website with Template is more like
    JavaScript App than C# despite binding directly to .NET APIs behind the scenes.
</p>

<h4>Ultimate Development Experience</h4>

<p>
    In addition to simplicity, the iterative development experience is unparalleled for a .NET App where for the most part
    you can just leave the <em>web</em> exe running and add the <em>.html</em> template files needed to build your App. 
    No pre-compilation is required so you can just refresh your page to instantly view modified changes.
</p>

<h4>Extensible Base</h4>

<p>
    Whilst we've developed a Self-contained .NET Core App 
    (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd">SCD</a>)
    to illustrate the conecept, the lightweight
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplateWebsites/tree/master/src/TemplateWebsites">Template Websites</a> also serves as 
    a good foundation to be able to enhance it with any additional .NET Core or ServiceStack features you need which can be enhanced
    with custom App filters to enable a richer and more capable <em>web</em> exe that's more tailored to support your App's
    requirements. 
</p>

<p>
    If your development team is comprised of front-end and back-end .NET developers, the back-end developers can be responsible 
    for maintaining a customized <em>web</em> .exe containing all the features, APIs and back-end Services that's needed for
    front-end developers to implement your company's App requirements where they're able to develop several different Web Apps
    using the same <em>web</em> exe.
