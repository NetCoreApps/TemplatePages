<p>
    Templates are sandboxed, they can't call methods on objects nor do they have any access to any static functions built into the .NET Framework,
    so just as Arguments define all data and objects available to templates, filters define all functionality available to templates.     
</p>

<p>
    The only filters registered by default are the <a href="/docs/default-filters">Default Filters</a>
    containing a comprehensive suite of filters useful within View Engine or Template environments and 
    <a href="/docs/html-filters">HTML Filters</a>. 
    There's nothing special about these filters other than they're pre-registered by default, your filters have access to the same 
    APIs and functionality and can do anything that built-in filters can do. 
</p>

<h5 id="shadowing">Shadowing Filters</h5>

<p>
    You can easily override default filters with the same name and arguments by inserting them at the start of the <em>TemplateFilters</em> list:
</p>

<h5 id="removing">Removing Default Filters</h5>

<p>
    Or if you want to start from a clean slate, the default filters can be removed by clearing the collection:

<h4>What are Filters?</h4>

<p>
    Filters are just C# public instance methods from a class that inherits from <em>TemplateFilter</em>, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/03.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="registering-filters">Registering Filters</h4>

<p>
    The examples below show the number of different ways filters can be registered:
</p>

<h5>Add them to the TemplateContext.TemplateFilters</h5>

<p>
    Filters can be registered by adding them to the <em>context.TemplateFilters</em> collection directly:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/04.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>That can now be called with:</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/05.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    This also shows that Filters are initialized and have access to the <em>TemplateContext</em> through the <em>Context</em> property.
</p>

<h5>Add them to PageResult.TemplateFilters</h5>

<p>
    If you only want to use a custom filter in a single Template, it can be registered on the <em>PageResult</em> that renders it instead:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/06.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h5>Autowired using TemplateContext IOC</h5>

<p>
    Autowired instances of filters can also be created using TemplateContext's configured IOC where they're 
    also injected with any registered IOC dependencies. To utilize this you need to specify the Type of the filter that 
    should be Autowired by either adding it to the <em>ScanTypes</em> collection:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/07.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    When the <em>TemplateContext</em> is initialized it will go through each Type and create an autowired instance of each Type
    and register them in the <em>TemplateFilters</em> collection. An alternative to registering a single Type is to register 
    an entire Assembly, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/08.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    Where it will search each Type in the Assembly for Template Filters and automatically register them.
</p>

<h5>Filter Resolution</h5>

<p>
    Templates will use the first matching filter with the same name and argument count it can find by searching through all 
    filters registered in the <em>TemplateFilters</em> collection, so you could override default filters with the same name by 
    inserting your filters as the first item in the collection, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/09.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Auto coercion into Filter argument Types</h4>

<p>
    A unique feature of Filters is that each of their arguments are automatically coerced into the filter argument Type using the 
    powerful conversion facilities built into ServiceStack's 
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/auto-mapping">Auto Mapping Utils</a> and 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text">Text Serializers</a> which can deserialize most of .NET's primitive Types like 
    <em>DateTime</em>, <em>TimeSpan</em>, <em>Enums</em>, etc in/out of strings as well being able to convert a Collection into other Collection 
    Types and any Numeric Type into any other Numeric Type which is how, despite only accepting doubles: 
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/10.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    <em>squared</em> can also be used with any other .NET Numeric Type, e.g: <em>byte</em>, <em>int</em>, <em>long</em>, <em>decimal</em>, etc.
    The consequence to this is that there's no method overloading in filters, filters are matched based on their name and their number of arguments
    and each argument is automatically converted into its filter method Param Type before it's called.
</p>

<h4>Context Filters</h4>

<p>
    Filters can also get access to the current scope by defining a <em>TemplateScopeContext</em> as it's first parameter which 
    can be used to access arguments in the current scope or add new ones as done by the <em>assignTo</em> filter:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/11.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="block-filters">Block Filters</h4>

<p>
    Filters can also write directly into the OutputStream instead of being forced to return buffered output. A Block Filter
    is declared by its <em>Task</em> return Type where instead of returning a value it instead writes directly to the 
    <em>TemplateScopeContext</em> OutputStream as seem with the implementation of the <em>includeFile</em> protected filter:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/filters/12.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<blockquote>
    For maximum performance all default filters which perform any I/O use Block filters to write directly to the OutputStream 
    and avoid any blocking I/O or buffering. 
</blockquote>

<h4>Block Filters ends the filter chain</h4>

<p>
    Block filters effectively end the Filter chain expression since they don't return any value that can be injected into 
    a normal filter. The only thing that can come after a Block Filter are other Block Filters or Filter Transformers. 
    If any are defined, the output of the Block Filter is buffered into a <em>MemoryStream</em> and passed into
    the next Block Filter or Filter Transformer in the chain, its output is then passed into the next one in the chain if any, 
    otherwise the last output is written to the OutputStream.
</p>

<p>
    An example of using a Block filter with a Filter Transformer is when you want include a markdown document and then 
    convert it to HTML using the <b>markdown</b> Filter Transformer before writing its HTML output to the OutputStream:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ pass: 'doc.md' | includeFile | markdown }}</code></pre>

<h4>Capture Block Filter Output</h4>

<p>
    You can also capture the output of a Block Filter and assign it to a normal argument by using the <em>assignTo</em> Block Filter:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ pass: 'doc.md' | includeFile | assignTo: contents }}</code></pre>

{{ "doc-links" | partial({ order }) }}
