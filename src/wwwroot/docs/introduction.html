    ServiceStack Templates is a simple, highly-extensible, portable, sandboxed, high-performance general-purpose templating engine 
    for .NET and .NET Core. It's designed from the ground-up to incrementally adoptable where its basic usage is simple enough for
    non-technical users to use whilst it progressively enables access to more power and functionality allowing it to scale up to 
    support full server-rendering Web Server workloads and beyond, where its high-fidelity with JavaScript syntax allows it to 
    seamlessly integrate with client-side JavaScript Single Page App frameworks where its syntax is compatible with 
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html#Filters">Vue filters</a>.
</p>

<h3>Instant Startup</h3>

<p>
    There's no pre-compilation, pre-loading or Startup penalty in Template Pages, all Pages are lazily loaded on first use and cached for 
    fast subsequent access. Its instant Startup, fast runtime performance and sandboxed isolation opens it up to a myraid of use-cases which 
    can provide a Live programming experience to running .NET Apps.
</p>

<h3>Fast Runtime Performance</h3>

<p>
    Template Pages is fast, parsing is done using StringSegment for minimal GC pressure, all I/O is non-blocking including async
    writes to OutputStreams. There's no buffering: Layouts, Pages and Partials are asynchronously written to a forward only stream.
    There's also no runtime reflection, each binding within templates executes a compiled C# Expression.
</p>

<h3>Simple</h3>

<p>
    There's no language constructs embedded in Template Pages itself, all functionality is enabled by filters, where even the 
    default filters can be removed, stripping ServiceStack Templates back to its core functionality where the only functionality
    available within Templates is the concept of Layouts and where to insert the Page using simple "mustache" syntax:
</p>

{{ "live-pages" | partial(
    {
        page: 'page', 
        files: 
        { 
            '_layout.html': 'I am the Layout: <b>{{ page }}</b>',
            'page.html' : 'I am the Page' 
        } 
    }) 
}}

<h3>Simple Example Walkthrough</h3>

<p>
    To render the pages we first create and initialize a <em>TemplateContext</em>
</p>

<pre><code>var context = new TemplateContext().Init();</code></pre>

<p>
    The TemplateContext is the sandbox where all templates are executed within, everything your templates have access to and generates 
    is maintained within the TemplateContext. Pages are sourced from its configured
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system">Virtual File System</a> which by default uses an In Memory Virtual 
    File System which we can programatically populate:
</p>

<pre><code>context.VirtualFiles.Write("_layout.html", "I am the Layout: &lt;b&gt;{{ page }}&lt;/b&gt;");
context.VirtualFiles.Write("page.html", "I am the Page");
</code></pre>

<p>
    Templates are rendered using a <em>PageResult</em> essentially a rendering context that a minimum needs to be provided the Page to render:
</p>

<pre><code>var pageResult = new PageResult(context.GetPage("page"));</code></pre>

<p>
    The template output can then be asynchronously rendered to any Stream:
</p>

<pre><code>await pageResult.WriteToAsync(responseStream);</code></pre>

<p>
    Or if you just want to access the output as a string you can use the convenience extension method:
</p>

<pre><code>string output = await pageResult.RenderToStringAsync();</code></pre>

<p>
    All I/O within Templates are non-blocking, but if you're using the default In Memory Virtual FileSystem there is no I/O
    so you can safely block to get the generated output with:
</p>

<pre><code>string output = pageResult.Result;</code></pre>

<p>
    Both APIs returns the result you see in the Live Example above.
</p>

<h4>Cascading Layout Selection</h4>

<p>
    One key aspect missing above is how the layout the page was rendered in, was chosen? It simply chooses the <i>closest</i> 
    <em>_layout.html</em> it can find starting from the directory where the page is located, traversing all the way up until it 
    reaches the root directory. If no layout page was found, the page is rendered without one.
</p>

<p>
    If preferred, you can choose a different name for the default Layout page with:
</p>

<pre><code>context.DefaultLayoutPage = "_template";</code></pre>

{{ "doc-links" | partial({ order }) }}
