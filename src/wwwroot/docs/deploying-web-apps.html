<p>
    As all <a href="/docs/web-apps">Web Apps</a> use the same pre-compiled <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/Web">/web</a> binary, 
    deployment is greatly simplified as it only needs to be concerned with deploying static files and starting <em>web/app.dll</em> 
    with the App's <em>app.settings</em>. 
</p>

<h2>Deploying Web Apps to Ubuntu</h2>

<p>
    A common way for reliably hosting .NET Core Apps on Ubuntu is to use <a href="http://supervisord.org/index.html">supervisor</a> 
    to monitor the <em>dotnet</em> self-hosting processes behind an nginx reverse proxy which handles external HTTP requests to
    your website and proxies them to the dotnet process running your Web App on a local port. You'll need access to a Unix 
    environment on your client Desktop, either using Linux, OSX or 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows#option-1-install-redis-on-ubuntu-on-windows">Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>.

### Setup the deploy User Account

Using a Unix command-line or [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows#option-1-install-redis-on-ubuntu-on-windows) 
ssh into your remote server:

    $ ssh deploy@web-apps.io

We'll start by creating a dedicated user account for hosting and running your .NET Core Apps to mitigate potential abuse. 
SSH into your Ubuntu server and create the `deploy` user account with a `/home/deploy` home directory and add 
them to the `sudo` group:

    sudo useradd -m deploy
    sudo usermod -aG sudo deploy

For seamless deployments use `visudo` to allow `deploy` to run `supervisorctl` without
prompting for a password:

    # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
    %deploy ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/supervisorctl, /home/deploy/.dotnet/tools/web

> In vi type `i` to start editing a file and `ESC` to quit edit mode and `:wq` to save your changes before exiting.

For simplifying the one-time setup, it's easier to sign-in as super user:

    $ sudo su -

#### Install the dotnet `web` tool:

    $ dotnet tool install -g web

Change into the directory where want to install the app:

    $ cd /home/deploy/apps

Install your app from your GitHub project:

    $ web install spirals --source mythz

Optional, but you can test that your app runs without issues with:

    $ cd spirals && web

#### Setup nginx

To setup the nginx reverse proxy for this website change into:

    $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/

Then create an nginx website configuration template with:

    web init nginx

Rename it to the domain name you want to host it under:

    $ mv my-app.web-app.io spirals.web-app.io

Edit the file and replace it to use your App settings:

    $ vi spirals.web-app.io

Specifically you want to change the **domain name** and **port** you want to host it on which you can do quickly with the search/replace commands:

    :%s/my-app.web-app.io/spirals.web-app.io/g
    :%s/5000/5009/g 

Then type `:wq` to quit vi. To enable the site in nginx we need to create a symbolic link in `/sites-enabled`:

    $ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/spirals.web-app.io /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/spirals.web-app.io

Then reload `nginx` to pick up changes:

    $ /etc/init.d/nginx reload

#### Setup supervisor

Now that we have our website configured with nginx we need to setup supervisor to start and monitor the .NET Core process by changing into:

    $ cd /etc/supervisor/conf.d

Then generate a supervisor configuration template with:

    $ web init supervisor

Rename it to your Web App's folder name:

    $ mv app.my-app.conf app.spirals.conf

Then use vi to customize the configuration for your App: 

    $ vi app.spirals.conf

If your apps are located in `/home/deploy/apps/` then you can just run the Search/Replace rules:

    :%s/my-app/spirals/g
    :%s/5000/5009/g

Which will change it to:

    [program:app-spirals]
    command=/home/deploy/.dotnet/tools/web --release
    directory=/home/deploy/apps/spirals
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    stderr_logfile=/var/log/app-spirals.err.log
    stdout_logfile=/var/log/app-spirals.out.log
    environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production,ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://*:5009/"
    user=deploy
    stopsignal=INT

> The `--release` flag overrides **debug** in `app.settings` so it's always run in release mode.

After reviewing the changes, tell supervisor to register and start the supervisor process with:

    $ supervisorctl update

Where your website will now be up and running at: [spirals.web-app.io](http://spirals.web-app.io).

### Deploying Updates

After the one-time setup above, updating Web Apps are more easily done with:

    $ cd /home/deploy/apps
    $ sudo /home/deploy/.dotnet/tools/web install spirals --source mythz
    $ sudo supervisorctl restart app-spirals

Which can also be deployed from the Windows Command Prompt using a remote SSH command by combining the above commands in a `deploy-spirals.sh` text file:

    ssh -t deploy@web-app.io "cd /home/deploy/apps && sudo /home/deploy/.dotnet/tools/web install spirals --source mythz && sudo supervisorctl restart app-spirals"

Where App updates can then be performed with a single WSL bash command from the Windows Command Prompt:

    $ bash deploy-spirals.sh

### Using Travis CI to deploy using Docker to AWS ECS

A popular combination for deploying .NET Core Apps is to use the online [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
Continuous Integration Service to package your App in a Docker Container and deploy it to AWS ECS which takes care of
the management and deployment of Docker instances over a configured cluster of EC2 compute instances.

The easiest way to set this up is to clone the [rockwind-aws](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws)
Web App which is preconfigured with a working scripts using Travis CI to package the Web App in a Docker container 
and deploy it to AWS ECS. In your local copy replace the 
[/app](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws/tree/master/app) folder with your App files, e.g:

#### [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws/blob/master/Dockerfile)

{{ 'gfm/deploying-web-apps/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    The only other file that needs to change is <em>deploy-envs.sh</em> to configure it to use your App's deployment settings:
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws/blob/master/deploy-envs.sh">deploy-envs.sh</a></h4>

{{ 'gfm/deploying-web-apps/03.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Setup AWS ECS and Travis CI</h4>

<p>
    After configuring your App deployment scripts you'll then need to 
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#1-create-the-ecsinstancerole-role">Setup your AWS ECS</a>
    with an EC2 instance to deploy to and 
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#create-project-in-travis-ci">Create your project in Travis CI</a>.
    You'll then need to add your AWS Account details in the Travis CI project using
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#ci-environment-variables">Secure Environment Variables</a>
    to store your <em>AWS_ACCOUNT_ID</em>, <em>AWS_ACCESS_KEY</em> and <em>AWS_SECRET_KEY</em> as well as any sensitive info and 
    connection strings your App uses.
