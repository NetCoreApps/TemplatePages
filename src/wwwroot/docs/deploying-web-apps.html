title: Deploying Web Apps
order: 26
-->

<p>
    As all <a href="/docs/web-apps">Web Apps</a> use the same pre-compiled <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Web">/web</a> binary, 
    deployment is greatly simplified as it only needs to be concerned with deploying static files and starting <em>web/app.dll</em> 
    with the App's <em>web.settings</em>. 
</p>

<h3>Deploying multiple Web Apps to Ubuntu</h3>

<p>
    A common way for reliably hosting .NET Core Apps on Ubuntu is to use <a href="http://supervisord.org/index.html">supervisor</a> 
    to monitor the <em>dotnet</em> self-hosting processes behind an nginx reverse proxy which handles external HTTP requests to
    your website and proxies them to the dotnet process running your Web App on a local port. You'll need access to a Unix 
    environment on your client Desktop, either using Linux, OSX or 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows#option-1-install-redis-on-ubuntu-on-windows">Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>.
</p>

<h4>Setup the deploy User Account</h4>

<p>
    We'll start by creating a dedicated user account for hosting and running your .NET Core Apps to mitigate potential abuse. 
    SSH into your Ubuntu server and create the <em>deploy</em> user account with a <em>/home/deploy</em> home directory and add 
    them to the <em>sudo</em> group:
</p>

<pre class="sh"><code>sudo useradd -m deploy
sudo usermod -aG sudo deploy</code></pre>

<p>
    For seamless deployments use <em>visudo</em> to allow <em>deploy</em> to run <em>supervisorctl</em> without
    prompting for a password:
</p>

<pre class="txt"><code># Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%deploy ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/supervisorctl</code></pre>

<blockquote>
    In vi type <em>i</em> to start editing a file and <em>ESC</em> to quit edit mode and <em>:wq</em> to save your changes before exiting.
</blockquote>

<h4>Setup supervisor</h4>

<p>
    Install supervisor using apt-get:
</p>

<pre class="sh"><code>sudo apt-get install supervisor</code></pre>

<p>
    You'll need to create a separate config file for each app in <em>/etc/supervisor/conf.d/</em>. 
    We can use the same template below for all 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/WebApp/tree/master/src/apps">/apps</a> by replacing <em>bare</em>
    with the name of the App:
</p>

<h5>/etc/supervisor/conf.d/web.bare.conf</h5>

<pre class="txt"><code>[program:web-bare]
command=/usr/bin/dotnet /home/deploy/apps/web/app.dll web.bare.settings
directory=/home/deploy/apps/web
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/web-bare.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/web-bare.out.log
environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
user=deploy
stopsignal=INT</code></pre>

<h4>Setup nginx</h4>

<p>
    You'll also need to create a separate config for each website on nginx in <em>/etc/nginx/sites-available/</em>. 
    You can use the same template for each website but you'll need to change the <em>server_name</em> with the domain name
    you want to use for the App and use a different port number for each App:
</p>

<h5>/etc/nginx/sites-available/bare.web-app.io</h5>

<pre class="txt"><code>server {
    listen       80;
    server_name bare.web-app.io;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_ignore_client_abort off;
        proxy_intercept_errors on;

        client_max_body_size 500m;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    You'll then need to create symlink for each website to tell nginx you want each website to be enabled:
</p>

<pre class="sh"><code>ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bare.web-app.io /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bare.web-app.io</code></pre>

<p>
    After this we can tell nginx to reload its configuration, as there's nothing listening to <em>http://localhost:5001</em>
    yet nginx will return a 502 Bad Gateway response, but will start working as soon as our deployed .NET Core Apps are up and running.
</p>

<pre class="sh"><code>/etc/init.d/nginx reload</code></pre>

<h5>Setting up SSH keys</h5>

<p>
    We can now exit our remote Linux server and return to our local machine and prepare our deployment script. 
    Before doing this we recommend 
    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2">setting up SSH and copying your SSH public key to your remote server</a>
    which is both more secure and more convenient than using a password.
</p>

<h4>Create the deployment script</h4>

<p>
    We use <em>sed</em> in our deployment script to generate the release web.settings from each App's local <em>web.settings</em>    
    that we save in the <em>/web</em> folder that gets deployed with our apps. The main configuration to change is to set 
    <em>debug false</em> and to select a different port number which matches the port number used in its nginx configuration. 
    We can then use <em>rsync</em> to efficiently copy all <em>/app</em> and <em>/web</em> folders to our remote server and use 
    ssh to run a remote command instructing <em>supervisorctl</em> to restart all its Services:
</p>

<h5>deploy.apps.sh</h5>

{{ 'gfm/deploying-web-apps/01.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Run the deployment script</h4>

<p>
    To run the deployment script we need to make it executable before running it:
</p>

<pre class="sh"><code>chmod +x deploy.apps.sh
./deploy.apps.sh</code></pre>

<p>
    If all went well you'll be able to view each app using the domain name they've been configured with in nginx.     
    Now whenever you need to redeploy again you'll only need to re-run <em>./deploy.apps.sh</em> which will only copy the files that
    have changed before restarting all services. 
</p>

<p>
    You can also choose to restart only the app that was changed by specifying its <em>program</em> name in 
    <em>/etc/supervisor/conf.d/web.*.conf</em>, e.g:
</p>

<pre class="sh"><code>ssh deploy@web-app.io "sudo supervisorctl restart web-bare"</code></pre>

<h3>Using Travis CI to deploy using Docker to AWS ECS</h3>

<p>
    A popular combination for deploying .NET Core Apps is to use the online <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> 
    Continuous Integration Service to package your App in a Docker Container and deploy it to AWS ECS which takes care of
    the management and deployment of Docker instances over a configured cluster of EC2 compute instances.
</p>

<p>
    The easiest way to set this up is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Rockwind.Aws">Rockwind.Aws</a>
    Web App which is preconfigured with a working scripts using Travis CI to package the Web App in a Docker container 
    and deploy it to AWS ECS.
    In your local copy replace the <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Rockwind.Aws/tree/master/app">/app</a> folder with your
    App files then you'll then change the url in the <em>Dockerfile</em> to point to a plain-text copy of your App's 
    <em>web.settings</em>, e.g:
</p>

<h5><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Rockwind.Aws/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a></h5>

{{ 'gfm/deploying-web-apps/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    The only other file that needs to change is <em>deploy-envs.sh</em> to configure it to use your App's deployment settings:
</p>

<h5><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Rockwind.Aws/blob/master/deploy-envs.sh">deploy-envs.sh</a></h5>

{{ 'gfm/deploying-web-apps/03.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Setup AWS ECS and Travis CI</h4>

<p>
    After configuring your App deployment scripts you'll then need to 
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#1-create-the-ecsinstancerole-role">Setup your AWS ECS</a>
    with an EC2 instance to deploy to and 
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#create-project-in-travis-ci">Create your project in Travis CI</a>.
    You'll then need to add your AWS Account details in the Travis CI project using
    <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#ci-environment-variables">Secure Environment Variables</a>
    to store your <em>AWS_ACCOUNT_ID</em>, <em>AWS_ACCESS_KEY</em> and <em>AWS_SECRET_KEY</em> as well as any sensitive info and 
    connection strings your App uses.
