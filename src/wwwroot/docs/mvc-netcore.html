<p>
    The easiest way to enable Templates support in a .NET Core App is to register an empty ServiceStack AppHost
    with the <em>TemplatePagesFeature</em> plugin enabled:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/mvc-netcore/01.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    This let you use the <a href="/docs/view-engine">View Engine</a> and <a href="/docs/code-pages">Code Pages</a> features
    to build your entire .NET Core Web App with Templates without needing to use anything else in ServiceStack.
</p>

<h4>MVC PageResult</h4>

<p>
    Just as you can use a ServiceStack Service as the Controller for a Template Page View, you can also use an MVC Controller
    which works the same way as a Service, but instead of returning the <em>PageResult</em> directly, you need to call 
    <em>ToMvcResult()</em> extension method to wrap it in an MVC ActionResult, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/mvc-netcore/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    This has the same effect as it has in a ServiceStack Service where the <em>PageResult</em> sets the Content-Type 
    HTTP Response Header and asynchronously writes the template to the Response OutputStream for maximum performance.
</p>

<h4>Sharing Dependencies</h4>

<p>
    Unfortunately you'd need to resolve <em>ITemplatePages</em> directly from ServiceStack's IOC as dependencies registered in 
    ServiceStack's IOC aren't visible in .NET Core MVC but dependencies registered in .NET Core MVC are visible in ServiceStack
    so to have the same dependencies available to both .NET Core MVC and ServiceStack you would instead register it in .NET Core's 
    IOC then resolve the same instance in your ServiceStack AppHost, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/mvc-netcore/03.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    This will then let you access <em>ITemplatePages</em> as a normal dependency in your MVC Controller:

<h4>Using Templates without a ServiceStack AppHost</h4>

<p>
    If you don't need the <a href="/docs/view-engine">View Engine</a> support and would like to use Templates without a 
    ServiceStack AppHost you can, just register a <em>TemplateContext</em> instance in .NET Core's IOC, replace
    its Virtual File System to point to the <em>WebRootPath</em> and you can start returning PageResult's as above:
