<p>
    Templates has a simple, but effective configuration-free hot-reloading feature built-in that's enabled 
    when registering the <a href="/docs/view-engine">TemplatePagesFeature</a> plugin:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>Plugins.Add(new TemplatePagesFeature());</code></pre>

<p>
    It can then be enabled in your website by adding the expression below at the top of your <b>_layout.html</b>:
</p>

<pre class="cs">{{ pass: ifDebug | select: &lt;script&gt;{ '/js/hot-loader.js' | includeFile }&lt;/script&gt; }}</pre>

<p>
    This will embed the dependency-free <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/js/hot-loader.js">hot-loader.js</a>
    script during <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/debugging#debugmode">development</a> to poll the service endpoint below:
</p>

<pre class="url"><code>/templates/hotreload/page?path=path/to/page&amp;eTag=lastETagReceived</code></pre>

<p>
    Which responds with whether or not the client should reload their current page, preserving their current scroll offset.
</p>

<blockquote>
    An easy way to temporarily disable hot reloading is to prefix the expression with the <em>end</em> filter 
    <em>{{ pass: end | ifDebug ... }}</em> or if preferred you can just use comments <em>{{&zwnj;* ifDebug ... *&zwnj;}}</em> 
</blockquote>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>
    The Service is just a wrapper around the <em>ITemplatePages.GetLastModified(page)</em> API which returns the 
    last modified date of the page and any of its dependencies by scanning each expression in the page's AST to 
    find each referenced partial or included file to find the most recent modified date which it compares against 
    the eTag provided by the client to determine whether or not any of the pages resources have changed.
</p>

<p>
    Since it's just scanning the AST instead of evaluating it, it will only be able to find files and partials 
    that were staticaly referenced, i.e. with a string literal as opposed to a dynamically created string.
</p>
