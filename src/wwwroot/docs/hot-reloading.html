<p>
    Templates has a simple, but effective configuration-free hot-reloading feature built-in that's enabled 
    when registering the <a href="/docs/view-engine">TemplatePagesFeature</a> plugin:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/hot-reloading/01.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    It can then be enabled in your website by adding the expression below at the top of your <b>_layout.html</b>:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/hot-reloading/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    This will embed the dependency-free <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/js/hot-loader.js">hot-loader.js</a>
    script during <a href="http://docs.servicestack.net/debugging#debugmode">development</a> to poll the service endpoint below:
</p>

<pre class="url"><code>/templates/hotreload/page?path=path/to/page&amp;eTag=lastETagReceived</code></pre>

<p>
    Which responds with whether or not the client should reload their current page, preserving their current scroll offset.
</p>

<blockquote>
    An easy way to temporarily disable hot reloading is to surround the expression with the <em>noop</em> block 
    <em>{{#raw}}{{#noop}}{{#if debug}} ...{{/noop}}{{/raw}}</em> or if preferred you can just use comments 
    <em>{{#raw}}{{* #if debug ... *}}{{/raw}}</em> 
</blockquote>

<h4>When to reload</h4>

<p>
    Hot Reloading only monitors Template Pages. You'll need to do a hard refresh with <em>Ctrl+Shift+F5</em> if making changes to 
    <em>.css</em> or <em>.js</em> to force the browser to not use its cache. For App Code or Configuration changes you'll 
    need to restart your App to pick up the changes.
</p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>
    The Service is just a wrapper around the <em>ITemplatePages.GetLastModified(page)</em> API which returns the 
    last modified date of the page and any of its dependencies by scanning each expression in the page's AST to 
    find each referenced partial or included file to find the most recent modified date which it compares against 
    the eTag provided by the client to determine whether or not any of the pages resources have changed.
</p>

<p>
    Since it's just scanning the AST instead of evaluating it, it will only be able to find files and partials that were 
    statically referenced, i.e. the typical case of using a string literal for the file name as opposed to a dynamically creating it.
