<p>
    Another useful feature of Templates is that it operates within a controlled sandbox where each <em>TemplateContext</em> instance is 
    isolated and defines the entire execution environment on which Templates are executed within as such it should be safe to run
    Templates from untrusted 3rd Party sources as they're confined to what's available within their allowed <em>TemplateContext</em> instance. 
</p>

<h4>TemplateContext</h4>

<p>
    The only functionality a new <em>TemplateContext</em> instance has access to are the 
    <a href="/docs/default-filters">safe set of default filters</a> and the <a href="/docs/transformers#htmlencode">htmlencode Filter Transformer</a>.
    Templates can't call methods on instances or have any other way to invoke a method unless it's explicitly registered. 
</p>

<p>
    If running a template from an untrusted source we recommend running them within a new <em>TemplateContext</em> instance so they're 
    kept isolated from any other <em>TemplateContext</em> instance. Context's are cheap to create, so there wont be a noticable delay when 
    executing in a new instance but they're used to cache compiled lambda expressions which will need to be recreated if executing Templates
    in new TemplateContext instances. For improved performance you can instead have all untrusted templates use the same
    TemplateContext instance that way they're able to reuse compiled expressions.
</p>

<h4 id="remove-default-filters">Remove default filters</h4>

<p>
    If you want to start from a clean slate, the default filters can be removed by clearing the <em>TemplateFilters</em> collection:
</p>

<pre><code>context.TemplateFilters.Clear();</code></pre>

<h4 id="disable-filters">Disabling adhoc Filters</h4>

<p>
    Or if you only want to disable access to some filters without removing them all, you can disable access to adhoc filters
    by adding to the <em>ExcludeFiltersNamed</em> collection:
</p>

<pre class="cs">var context = new TemplateContext {
    ExcludeFiltersNamed = { "partial", "selectPartial" }
}.Init();</pre>

<blockquote>
    Filters can also be disabled on an individual <em>PageResult</em> ExcludeFiltersNamed.
</blockquote>

<h4>Instance creation and MaxQuota</h4>

<p>
    The only instances that can be created within templates are what's allowed in 
    <a href="/docs/syntax#javascript-literals">JavaScript Literals</a> and the
    <a href="/docs/default-filters#generation">Generation and Repeating Filters</a>. To limit any potential CPU and GC abuse any default filters
    that can generate instances are limited to a <em>MaxQuota</em> of <b>10000</b> iterations. This quota can be modified with:    
</p>

<pre class="cs">var context = new TemplateContext {
    Args = {
        [TemplateConstants.MaxQuota] = 1000
    }
}.Init();</pre>
