<p>
    You can apply a chain of multiple Stream transformations to Template output using Transformers which are just functions that
    accept an Input Stream and return a modified Output Stream. The MarkdownPageFormat's <em>TransformToHtml</em> shows an example
    of a Transformer which converts Markdown Input and returns a Stream of HTML output:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/01.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="output-transformers">Output Transformers</h4>

<p>
    You can transform the entire output of a Template with Output Transformers which you would do if both your <b>_layout</b>
    and <b>page</b> both contain markdown, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h5>PageResult with Output Transformer</h5>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/03.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    After the Template is evaluated it's entire output gets passed into the chain of OutputTransformers defined, which in this case will
    send a MemoryStream of the generated Markdown Output into the <em>MarkdownPageFormat.TransformToHtml</em> transformer which returns
    a Stream of converted HTML which is what's written to the OutputStream.
</p>

<h4 id="page-transformers">Page Transformers</h4>

<p>
    You can also apply Transformations to only the Page's output using Page Transformers which you would do if only the <b>page</b> was in 
    Markdown and the <b>_layout</b> was already in HTML, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/04.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h5>PageResult with Page Transformer</h5>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/05.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="filter-transformers">Filter Transformers</h4>

<p>
    Filter Transformers are used to apply Stream Transformations to <a href="/docs/filters#block-filters">Block Filters</a> which you 
    could use if you only wanted to convert an embedded Markdown file inside a Page to HTML. You can register Filter Transformers 
    in either the TemplateContext's or PageResult's <em>FilterTransformers</em> Dictionary by assigning it the name you want it available in
    your Templates under, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/06.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h5>PageResult with Filter Transformer</h5>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/07.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="htmlencode">htmlencode</h4>

<p>
    The <em>htmlencode</em> Filter Transformer is pre-registered in TemplateContext which lets you encode Block Filter outputs
    which is useful when you want to HTML Encode a text file before embedding it in the page, e.g:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ pass: "page.txt" | includeFile | htmlencode }}</code></pre>

{{ "doc-links" | partial({ order }) }}
