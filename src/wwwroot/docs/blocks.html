While filters lets you access methods within filter expressions, blocks lets you define reusable statement blocks that can be invoked with
a new context there by allowing you to create custom iterators and helpers - encapsulating reusable functionality and reducing boilerplate
for common functionality.

The syntax for blocks follows the familiar [handlebars block helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html) in both syntax and functionality.
Templates also includes many of handlebars block helpers which are useful in a HTML template language and reduces any porting efforts if
wanting to reuse existing handlebars templates.

We'll walk through creating a few of the built-in templates to demonstrate how we can create new block filters from scratch.

### noop

We'll start with creating the `noop` block (short for "no operation") which functions like a block comment by removing its inner contents
from the rendered page:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/01.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
The `noop` block is also the smallest implementation possible which needs to inherit `TemplateBlock` class, overrides the `Name` getter with 
the name of the block and implements the `WriteAsync()` method which for the noop block just returns an empty `Task` there by not writing anything 
to the Output Stream, resulting in its inner contents being ignored:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
All Block's are executed with 3 parameters:

 - `TemplateScopeContext` - Contains the current Execution and Rendering context
 - `PageBlockFragment` - The data structure which holds the parsed Block contents
 - `CancellationToken` - The CancellationToken allowing the async render operation to be cancelled

<h3 id="registering-blocks">Registering Blocks</h3>

{{#markdown}}
The same flexible registration options for [Registering Filters](/docs/filters#registering-filters) is also available for registering blocks 
where if it wasn't already built-in, `TemplateNoopBlock` could be registered by adding it to the `TemplateBlocks` collection:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/03.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h5 id="scan-types">Autowired using TemplateContext IOC</h5>

{{#markdown}}
Autowired instances of blocks and filters can also be created using TemplateContext's configured IOC where they're also injected with any 
registered IOC dependencies by registering them in the `ScanTypes` collection: 
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/04.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
When the `TemplateContext` is initialized it will go through each Type and create an autowired instance of each Type and register them in the 
`TemplateBlocks` collection. An alternative to registering individual Types is to register an entire Assembly, e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/05.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
Where it will automatically register any Template Blocks or Filters contained in the specified Assembly.
{{/markdown}}

{{#markdown}}
### bold

A step up from `noop` is the **bold** Template Block which markup its contents within the `<b/>` tag:
{{/markdown}}

<pre>
{{#raw}}{{#bold}}This text will be bold{{/bold}}{{/raw}}
</pre>

{{#markdown}}
Where we write to the `OutputStream` on the current `TemplateScopeContext` before and after the Block's inner contents are written out to the 
`OutputStream` verbatim using the `WriteBodyAsync()` base method:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/06.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
### with

The `with` Block shows an example of utilizing arguments. To maximize flexibility arguments passed into your block are captured in a free-form
string (specifically a `ReadOnlyMemory<char>`) which allows creating Blocks varying from simple arguments to complex LINQ-like expressions - a
feature that some of the built-in Blocks take advantage of. 

The `with` block works similarly to [handlebars with helper](https://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html#with-helper) or JavaScript's 
[with statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with) where it extracts the properties (or Keys)
of an object (or result of an Expression) and adds them to the current scope where by alleviating needing for prefixing each property reference, 
e.g. being able to use `{{Name}}` instead of {{person.Name}} and will only evaluate the block's contents if the argument doesn't evaluate to `null`.

<pre>
{{#with person}}
    Hi {{Name}}, your Age is {{Age}}.
{{/with}}
</pre>

The implementation below shows the optimal way to implement the `with` block by calling `GetJsExpressionAndEvaluate()` which resolves a cached AST
token and then evaluates it to return the result of the Argument expression. 

If the argument evaluates to an object it calls the `ToObjectDictionary()` extension method to convert it into a `Dictionary<string,object>` 
then creates a new scope with each property added as arguments and then evaluate the block's Body contents with the new scope:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/07.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
To have a better highlight how this works, a non-cached version of `GetJsExpressionAndEvaluate()` involves parsing the Argument string into 
an AST Token then evaluating it with the current scope:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/08.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
The `ParseJsExpression()` extension method is able to parse virtually any [JavaScript Expression](/docs/expression-viewer) into an AST tree
which can then be evaluated by calling its `token.Evaluate(scope)` method.

#### final implementation

The actual [TemplateWithBlock.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/Templates/Blocks/TemplateWithBlock.cs)
used in Templates has extended functionality which instead uses `GetJsExpressionAndEvaluateAsync()` to be able to evaluate both **sync** and **async** 
results and also evaluates the `block.ElseBlocks` that's available to each block where they're able to evaluate an **else/else if** expression 
statements for when blocks are called with an empty argument.

### if

Since all blocks are able to execute any number of `{{else}}` expressions by calling the `WriteElseAsync()` base method, the implementation for 
the `{{if}}` block ends up being even simpler where it just needs to evaluate the argument to `bool`, where if it's true it writes the 
body with `WriteBodyAsync()` otherwise it evaluates any else expressions with `WriteElseAsync()`:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/10.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
### each

Given everything we know so far implementing [handlebars.js each block](https://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html#iterators) is also fairly
straightforward to implement which essentially just involves iterating over the collection argument and rewriting the body with a new scope
containing the element with the conventional `it` binding, it's properties and an `index` argument that the block's template can use to determine the 
index of each element:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/11.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
Despite its terse implementation, the above Template Block can be used to iterate over any collection, inc. objects, POCOs strings as well as 
Value Type collections like ints. 

However the built-in [TemplateEachBlock.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/Templates/Blocks/TemplateEachBlock.cs)
is a lot larger and more feature-rich where it also includes support for async results, custom element bindings and LINQ-like syntax for 
maximum expressiveness as well as expression caching ensuring the complex argument expression is only parsed once.

### raw

The `{{#raw}}` block is similar to [handlebars.js's raw-helper](https://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html#raw-blocks) where it allows capturing
of the raw template text content instead having its contents evaluated making it ideal when wanting to emit content that could potentially contain
template expressions like client-side JavaScript or template expressions that you don't want to be evaluated on the server, e.g. when rending 
Vue, Angular or Ember templates:

<pre>
{{#raw}}
&lt;div id="app"&gt;
    {{ message }}
&lt;/div&gt;
{{/raw}}
</pre>

When called with no arguments it will render its unprocessed raw text contents. When called with a single argument, e.g. `{{#raw varname}}` it will
instead save the raw text contents to the specified global PageResult variable and lastly when called with the `appendTo` modifier it will append 
its contents to the existing variable, or initialize it if it doesn't already exist.

This is now the preferred approach used in all [.NET Core and .NET Framework Web Templates](http://docs.servicestack.net/templates-websites) for 
pages and partials to append any JavaScript script blocks they need, e.g:

<pre>
{{#raw appendTo scripts}}
&lt;script&gt;
    //...
&lt;/script&gt;
{{/raw}}
</pre>

To the bottom of the page by having its captured contents rendered at the [bottom of _layout.html](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/templates/blob/8a082a299d59a0b53b9b6e0a07a6fbabf7bf6e2c/MyApp/wwwroot/_layout.html#L49)

```
{{ scripts | raw }}
```

The implementation to support each of these usages is contained within 
[TemplateRawBlock.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/Templates/Blocks/TemplateRawBlock.cs)
below which inspects the `block.Argument` to determine whether it should capture the contents into the specified variable or write its raw 
string contents directly to the OutputStream:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/13.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
### capture

The `{{#capture}}` block is similar to the raw block except instead of using its raw text contents, it instead evaluates its contents instead 
and captures the output. It also supports evaluating the contents with scoped arguments where by each property in the object dictionary is added 
in the scoped arguments the template is executed with:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/blocks/14.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
With this we can generate some markdown, capture its contents and convert the resulting markdown to html using the  `markdown` Filter transformer:
