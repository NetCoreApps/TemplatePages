    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/WebApp">Web Apps</a> are a new approach to dramtically simplify .NET Wep App development 
    and provide the most productive development experience possible whilst maximizing re-use and component sharing. 
    They also open up a number of new use-cases for maintaining a clean isolation between front-end and back-end development with
    front-end developers not needing any knowledge of C#/.NET to be able to develop UIs for high-performance .NET Web Apps. 
    Web Apps also make it easy to establish and share an approved suite of functionality amongst multiple websites all 
    consuming the same back-end systems and data stores.
</p>

<p>
    Web Apps leverages Templates to develop entire content-rich, data-driven websites without needing to write any C#, 
    compile projects or manually refresh pages - resulting in the easiest and fastest way to develop Web Apps in .NET!
</p>

<h4>Ultimate Simplicity</h4>

<p>
    Not having to write any C# code or perform any app builds dramatically reduces the cognitive overhead and conceptual knowledge 
    required for development where the only thing front-end Web developers need to know is <a href="/docs/syntax">Template's syntax</a> 
    and what <a href="/docs/filters-reference">filters are available</a> to call. 
    Because of Template's high-fidelity with JavaScript, developing a Website with Templates will be instantly familiar to JavaScript 
    devs despite calling and binding directly to .NET APIs behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
    All complexity with C#, .NET, namespaces, references, .dlls, strong naming, packages, MVC, Razor, build tools, IDE environments, etc 
    has been eliminated leaving all Web Developers needing to do is run a cross-platform 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/WebApp">web/app.dll</a> .NET Core executable and configure a simple 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/WebApp/blob/master/src/apps/bare/web.settings">web.settings</a>    
    text file to specify which website folder to use, which ServiceStack features to enable, which db or redis providers to connect to, etc.
    Not needing to build also greatly simplifies deployments where multiple websites can be deployed with a 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/WebApp/blob/master/src/WebApp/run.deploy.apps.sh">single rsync</a> or xcopy command or 
    if deploying your App in a Docker Container, you just need to 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/WebApp/blob/master/Dockerfile">copy your website files</a>.
</p>

<h4>Rapid Dev Workflow</h4>

<p>
    The iterative development experience is also unparalleled for a .NET App, no compilation is required so you can just leave
    the <em>web/app.dll</em> running whilst you add the template <em>.html</em> files needed to build your App and thanks
    to the built-in <a href="/docs/hot-reloading">Hot Reloading</a> support, pages will refresh automatically as you save.
    You'll just need to do a full page refresh when modifying external .css/.js files to by-pass the browser cache and
    you'll need to restart <em>web/app.dll</em> to pick up any changes to your <em>web.settings</em> or added any 
    .dlls to your <em>/plugins</em> folder.
