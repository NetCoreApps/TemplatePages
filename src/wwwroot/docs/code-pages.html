    Another solution that enables greater control and functionality are <b>Code Pages</b> which utilize the 
    full unlimited power of the C# programming language to enable precise control over the rendering of pages and partials. 
    As Code Pages are normal C# classes they also benefit from the rich editing and debugging experience in C# IDEs 
    and don't require any special design-time editors, build tools or pre-compilation like Razor, they're just another class 
    in your Solution.
</p>

<h4>Creating Code Pages</h4>

<p>
    A Code Page is a class that inherits <em>TemplateCodePage</em> and is annotated with a <em>[Page(virtualPath)]</em> 
    attribute which is used to resolve the page in the same way <b>.html</b> pages are resolved by their virtualPath. 
    Code Pages take precedence over .html pages so you can start with an .html page and when you need more power and
    expressiveness, create a Code Page at the same virtualPath as the page you want to replace and it will get used instead.
    They also follow the same layout resolution rules as normal pages so they can be easily substituted when needed.
</p>

<p>
    Code Pages can also have metadata using the <em>[PageArg]</em> attribute which have the same behavior as 
    args in .html pages. 
</p>

<h5>render Method</h5>

<p>
    The last thing a Code Page needs is a <em>render</em> method which is what gets called to execute the page.
    The render method can have any number of parameters which will be populated with arguments of the same name
    that's in scope at the time when the Code Page is called. This enables the nice UX where the arguments can 
    be utilized in a C# interpolated string.
</p>

<p>
    A complete CodePage implementation using all these features is below:
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplatePages/blob/master/src/ProductsPage.cs">ProductsPage.cs</a></h4>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ "ProductsPage.cs" | includeContentFile | htmlencode }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Where with just this implementation, it can now be called by navigating to its virtualPath: <a href="/products">/products</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You typically wont need to explicitly register Code Pages since the <em>TemplatePagesFeature</em> populates its
    <em>ScanAssemblies</em> with the AppHost's Service assemblies which will automatically find and register any 
    TemplateCodePage's that are in the same Assembly as ServiceStack Services and just like Services, Code Pages 
    are autowired and resolved from the IOC transiently, so they can also be injected with any IOC registered dependencies
    by having them as public properties.
</p>

<h4>MVC Code Pages</h4>

<p>
    You can also combine the functionality enabled by levaraging ServiceStack Services in <a href="/model-view-controller">MVC Pages</a> 
    with the precise layout and expressiveness of Code Pages, where just like you can render a Page in a PageResult, you can render a 
    CodePage by resolving it with its virtualPath:
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplatePages/blob/master/src/ProductServices.cs">ProductServices.cs</a></h4>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ "ProductServices.cs" | includeContentFile | htmlencode }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Which is viewable at the Services Route: <a href="/products/view">/products/view</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Which displays exactly the same content as calling ProductsPage directly, but instead uses the Routing and the argument populated 
    by the ServiceStack Service, instead of the argument populated in the <em>TemplatePagesFeature</em> Arguments.
</p>


<h4>Code Pages as Partials</h4>

<p>
    Another area Code Pages are useful are as partials where they're able to escape the normal sandbox of Template Pages and
    and use C# to access the existing functionality available within your Web App. 
</p>

<h5>Partial Arguments</h5>

<p>
    You can an Object literal to pass arguments to Code Page partials (the same as page partials), where each property creates a 
    scoped argument that the Code Page has access to. 
</p>

<p>
    We'll show an example of this by building a simple <em>navLinks</em> Code Page partial where we pass in the links we want 
    generated when embed the partial:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ "examples/nav-links.txt" | includeFile }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Which will generate the following links of progressive advanced features, with the link of the current page highlighted:
</p>

{{ 'navLinks' | partial(
    { 
        links: { 
            '/docs/model-view-controller': 'MVC', 
            '/docs/view-engine': 'View Engine', 
            '/docs/code-pages': 'Code Pages'
        } 
    }) 
}}

<p>
    Using the <em>navLinks</em> implementation below where it can access both the <em>PathInfo</em> PageResult argument and 
    the <em>links</em> argument created when the partial was called:
</p>

<h4 id="code-page-partials"><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplatePages/blob/master/src/CodePagePartials.cs">CodePagePartials.cs</a></h4>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ "CodePagePartials.cs" | includeContentFile | htmlencode }}</code></pre>

<p>
    The <em>customerCard</em> partial shows another example where Code Pages are useful where they're able to access any IOC 
    dependency and existing Web App functionality, which can be called with:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ "examples/customer-card.txt" | includeFile }}</code></pre>

<p>
    To render a nice Customer Card snapshot:
</p>

{{ 'customerCard' | partial({ customerId: "ALFKI" }) }}

<h4>ServiceStack Code Pages</h4>

<p>
    <em>ServiceStackCodePage</em> is a convenience base class that inherits <em>TemplateCodePage</em> and enhances it with
    the same functionality that's available in ServiceStack's <em>Service</em> base class, e.g: access to the current
    <em>Request</em> context, Gateway, Database, Redis, CacheClient, Users Session, AuthRepository, etc.
</p>

<p>
    So you could rewrite the previous <a href="/docs/code-pages#code-page-partials">Code Page Partials</a> to inherit 
    ServiceStackCodePage instead where <em>NavLinksPartial</em> can access the <em>IRequest</em> directly without having to request
    the <em>PathInfo</em> argument and <em>CustomerCardPartial</em> has direct access to the configured database:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ "examples/servicestack-code-page.txt" | includeFile | htmlencode }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Since they have access to the same functionality ServiceStack Services do, ServiceStackCodePage's can provide
    an alternative to using Services in <a href="/docs/model-view-controller">Model View Controller</a>.
</p>


{{ "doc-links" | partial({ order }) }}
