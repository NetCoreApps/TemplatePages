<p>
    Simplicity is a driving goal behind the design of Templates where in its simplest form it's usable by non-programmers who just
    know HTML as they're able to embed dynamic content in their HTML pages using intuitive Mustache syntax and with the 
    intuitive way in how <a href="/docs/view-engine">View Engine works</a> they're able to develop entire content-heavy websites 
    without needing to write any code.
</p>

<p>
    As requirements become more demanding you can use progressively advanced features to enable greater flexibility and 
    functionality whilst still retaining using Templates to generate the HTML view with access to existing layouts and partials.
</p>

<p>
    The first option to enable functionality is to reuse the rich functionality available in Services to populate the data
    required by your view. To do this in ServiceStack add a reference to the <em>ITemplatePages</em> dependency which was registered 
    by <em>TemplateContext</em>, then return a <em>PageResult</em> containing the <em>.html</em> page you want to 
    render as well as any additional arguments you want available in the page:    
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplatePages/blob/master/src/CustomerServices.cs">CustomerServices.cs</a></h4>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ "CustomerServices.cs" | includeContentFile }}</code></pre>

<p>
    The above can Service can also be made slightly shorter by using the <em>Request.GetPage()</em> extension method, e.g:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>public class CustomerServices : Service
{
    public object Any(ViewCustomer request) =>
        new PageResult(Request.GetPage("examples/customer")) {
            Model = TemplateQueryData.GetCustomer(request.Id)
        };
}</code></pre>

<h5>Model PageResult Property</h5>

<p>
    The <em>Model</em> property is a special argument that automatically registers all its <b>public properties</b> as arguments 
    as well as registering itself in the <b>model</b> argument, this lets views reference model properties directly like
    <em>{{ pass: CustomerId }}</em> instead of the more verbose <em>{{ pass: model.CustomerId }}</em> as used in:
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/TemplatePages/blob/master/src/wwwroot/examples/customer.html">examples/customer.html</a></h4>

<pre class="tpl"><code>{{ "examples/customer.html" | includeFile | htmlencode }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Now that we have the Service handling the Request and populating the Model for our page we can use it to view each Customer
    in a nice detail page:
</p>

<div class="linq-preview">
    <div class="template">
        <textarea autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" class="form-control" 
            rows="4">{{ "examples/select-customers.txt" | includeFile }}</textarea>
    </div>
    <div class="result">
        <div class="output"></div>
    </div>
</div> 

{{ "doc-links" | partial({ order }) }}
